   <p class="p1">Paragraph 1: Much of the material for this volume was
       collected during the time that I was preparing for the press the
       Evolution of Woman, or while searching for data bearing on the subject
       of sex-specialization.</p>
   <p class="p2">Paragraph 2: While preparing that book for
       publication, it was my intention to include within it this branch of
       my investigation, but wishing to obtain certain facts relative to the
       foundations of religious belief and worship which were not accessible
       at that time, and knowing that considerable labor and patience would
       be required in securing these facts, I decided to publish the first
       part of the work, withholding for the time being that portion of it
       pertaining especially to the development of the God-idea.</p>
   <p class="p3">Paragraph 3: As mankind construct their own gods, or
       as the prevailing ideas of the unknowable reflect the inner
       consciousness of human beings, a trustworthy history of the growth of
       religions must correspond to the processes involved in the mental,
       moral, and social development of the individual and the nation. By
       means of data brought forward in these later times relative to the
       growth of the God-idea, it is observed that an independent chain of
       evidence has been produced in support of the facts recently set forth
       bearing upon the development of the two diverging lines of sexual
       demarcation.</p>

   <p class="p1">Paragraph 4: In other words, it has been found that
       sex is the fundamental fact not only in the operations of Nature but
       in the construction of a god.</p>

   <p class="p2">Paragraph 5: In the Evolution of Woman it has been
       shown that the peculiar inheritance of the two sexes, female and male,
       is the result of the bias given to these separate lines of development
       during the earliest periods of sex-differentiation; and, as this
       division of labor was a necessary step in the evolutionary processes,
       the rate of progress depended outdent-caply on the subsequent
       adjustment of these two primary elements or forces.</p>
   <p class="p3">Paragraph 6: A comprehensive study of prehistoric
       records shows that in an earlier age of existence upon the earth, at a
       time when womans influence was in the ascendancy over that of man,
       human energy was directed by the altruistic characters which
       originated in and have been transmitted through the female; but after
       the decline of womans power, all human institutions, customs, forms,
       and habits of thought are seen to reflect the egoistic qualities
       acquired by the male.</p>
